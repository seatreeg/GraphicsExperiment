# Graphics Experiment

The following repository is designed to house all of the important files for submission in the Graphics Experiment assignment.

main.pdf: The main paper, compiled as a PDF.

ExperimentProofOfConcept.html: An interactive document designed to be similar to the first part of the experiment. The experiment is ended early, with only one question following the tutorial. In the real experiment, there would be a functional group code for each experimental group, and the group code would indicate which type of graphic the participant was assigned, but this one only included groupcode 001, which is the Valid Grouping experimental group.

images -CopyZip.zip: Compressed file with the images used in the paper.

examFold - CopyZip.zip: Compressed file with a list of questions used to access the performance of users in the Valid Grouping 
experimental group. 

main.tex: The latex source file, used to compile the latex document

main.bib: The bib source file, used to compile the latex document
